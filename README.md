Find the line with 'CMSIS-DAP v2 Interface' and issue this command using the bus id from the above command. For this example i use bus id 1-5


```cmd
usbipd bind --busid 1-5
```

In a non-admin normal command prompt, you can attach the device to WSL:

```cmd
usbipd attach --wsl --busid 1-5
```

In WSL, you can use **lsusb** to see if the device is attached:

```bash
lsusb
```

```
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0002 Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 2e8a:000c Raspberry Pi Debug Probe (CMSIS-DAP)
Bus 002 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0003 Linux Foundation 3.0 root hub
```

> [!NOTE]
> Attaching the device in WSL is not persistent. You can use the SetupPicoProbe.bat as a scheduled task executed at login. (Please change the bus id to the one that is correct for your setting)
